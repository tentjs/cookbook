      p.
        This is an example of how to persist some data in the session/local storage.
      p.
        What's going on here is that, the component will initially attempt to get from session storage,
        but if nothing exists it will set a list in state, and set the same list in session storage.
      p.
        This means that if there was a list saved at some point of time in the current session, the component
        would use that list.
      p.
        Session storage could be changed with Local storage making it even more useful, since that is persisted
        throughout sessions.
